            <h1>The Idea</h1>
            <p>In an Advanced Human Computer Interaction class (IT 555) we were tasked with building a community.  In our groups years at BYU we have been frequent customers of the Cougar Eat.  However, as we passed through the food court with our design prompt in mind we noticed that while all the tables had at least two chairs, only one person was sitting at each table.  So we surveyed those who were sitting alone and came up with some interesting results.  Enjoy conversations with strangers, but do not have them because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They think they other person is busy and unwilling to talk.</li>
                <li>They want to connect with others but they don't know how.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So we designed the Talk Blok to break these barriers and build the campus community at BYU. The physical Talk Blok placed on a table seeks to break the busyness barrier.  Turn the green side up and you are ready to talk, flip the red side up and you are actually busy.  We coupled the each Bloc with the web application to solve the connection problem.  </p>
